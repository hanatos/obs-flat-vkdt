# example projects

in this directory is a loose collection of `.cfg` files with examples. to be
able to see them, you should have some random `test.cr2`, `test.jpg` and
`test.pfm` files as input for the graphs to work on.

`vkdt` will know it's the `examples/` directory and not overwrite the files,
so experiment away in the gui with them. your changes will be discarded at the
end. copy the files to another directory (along with a source image file) to
make your changes persistent.
