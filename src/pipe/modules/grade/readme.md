# grade: simple colour grading via lift gamma gain (ACES CDL)

this implements the popular and simple lift gamma gain scheme
to colour grade images.

note that it works in rgb and may result in out of gamut/spectral
locus colours.

this is in fact using the ACES colour decision list (CDL) formula for
slope/offset/power but i didn't rename the parameters because it's so similar.
also this does not work in log space nor in ACEScc colour space, so in a way
it's different anyways.

## parameters

* `lift` a 3-vector for red green blue to lift the blacks
* `gamma` a 3-vector for red green blue to push the gamma (affects the mid tones mostly)
* `gain` a 3-vector for red green blue gain. this affects the whole image (but mostly pins the highlights) and works as rgb white balance coefficients would.
