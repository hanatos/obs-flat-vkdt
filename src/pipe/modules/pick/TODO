write_sink()
write to module params? so we can visualise in gui controls

output to buffer? so we can plug it into another module, such as colour lut/matching

both? check whether graph will produce compute shaders for sinks
else have separate sink node to update module params + output node with collect rgb shader
params:
- number of spots
- spots/area
- "output" rgb
