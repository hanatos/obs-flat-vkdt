# test10b: draw gradient to test 10 bit display

this is just a simple module to render a gradient [0, 0.5]. it can be used to
test whether your x is setup to render 10 bit/channel (i.e. 30 bit per pixel)
correctly. you can run it with the example config:

```
$ ./vkdt examples/test10b.cfg
```

you should observe some banding on 8-bit and a smooth gradient in 10-bit.
zooming in can help discover artifacts.

note that vkdt now supports dithering on all bit depths, so without disabling
this it will be hard to see artifacts at all (would need to pass a
fake-high-bitdepth to `ImGui_ImplVulkan_SetDisplayProfile`).
