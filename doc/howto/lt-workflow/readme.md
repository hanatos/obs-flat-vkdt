# how to efficiently work through many images

when coming back from an event or field trip, photographers are often confronted
with thousands of images and the task to select a few keepers for further postprocessing.
this can be time-consuming and in general daunting because of the sheer amount of work.

the following presents an example workflow that has been proposed by your friendly
darktable community.

## import from flash cards

the `files` view in `vkdt` provides some basic tools to mount/unmount flash
cards and run (several parallel) import jobs in the background which copy files
from the mounted locations to a specified folder on your harddrive. if this
isn't for you, you can just copy and admin your images as you prefer (for
instance using [rapid photo downloader](https://damonlynch.net/rapid/)).

you can already start looking at your (already copied) images in lighttable or
darkroom views while `vkdt` is still copying the rest.

this screenshot shows the import in progress in the files view:

## tools for rating

to rate images both in lighttable and darkroom views, there are keyboard
hotkeys. the default is the numbers: 0 for zero stars, 1 to assign one star, 2
for two (you get the idea). you can configure that for lighttable and darkroom
mode individually in the settings â†’ hotkey menu.

in darkroom mode, there are also hotkeys for combined *upvote and advance* and
*downvote and advance* which will increase or decrease the star rating and go
to the next image. these bindings lend themselves to a workflow where you
would go over your list of images iteratively, by up or downvoting them.

using the collection interface in lighttable mode, you can restrict the list
to only images with a certain rating after you have finished a pass.

during a rating pass, to view an image full screen without distracting ui
controls, you can hide the right panel in darkroom view by pressing the tab
key.

## techniques against fatigue

especially when reviewing a large number of very similar images, it can be
tiresome to work through the list. it is therefore essential to have strategies
against this reviewing fatigue. here are some ideas.

### small groups
reducing the number of images visible in the current collection has a big
psychological impact. going through a few tens of images seems much more a
doable task than looking at say 1000. it is thus a good idea to break down
the long list into smaller groups.

one idea is to go through your images day by day. this workflow is supported
by the collection interface in lighttable mode. if you sorted your collection
by date, there will be button next to the filter by date entry to generate
one quick access button for every day in the current collection.

if a single day is not fine grained enough, or there are many very similar
photos for a different reason, assign such groups a temporary colour label,
filter by this label, and then select the best shot.
similar to star ratings, labels can be assigned via hotkeys to be configured
in both lighttable and darkroom modes. the default keys are the function keys f1..f5.

### randomise the work
if the whole bulk of images is too much to work on, maybe there are random
groups or sub-events that catch your attention. in this case one approach is to
first assign one star to all images to signify: you did not look at this image
yet, it is unrated. you can then select a random list of images to use the
upvote/downvote workflow. this results in a list of zero-rated images and one
of 2-rated images, so for future passes it is clearly apparent that you already
rated these images.

### casual interfaces
to be comfortable with your worflow, it might be good to assign convenient individual keyboard shortcuts.

vkdt also offers a gamepad interface for a different approach. this works with
bluetooth controllers while sitting on a couch with a larger monitor
(projector, television?).

## export
it is sometimes beneficial to look at your images in a different context, or 
export a *contact sheet* or a gallery for your friends and family to look at.

`vkdt` has a special output module, `o-web` which will export jpg and mp4 video
files, depending on the input type.

this list can then be viewed in the external image viewer of your choice. you
can also navigate to this directory and execute
```
$ vkdt gallery
```
to create an html gallery to be viewed in browsers. this is what it will look
like in firefox (though you're of course free to tweak the css at will):

congratulations, you just finished a full front-to-back initial review pass over your images!
